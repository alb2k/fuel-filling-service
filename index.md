A helidon (microprofile) RESTful webservice with microstream.

The project represents a basic CRUD webservice where you can manage fuel fillings (of a car).<br>
It is also shipped with a nice UI (openapi-ui) so that no external REST/HTTP client is required.

This project was created for the [Microstream hackathon](https://hackathon.microstream.one/)

There are prebuilt executables, which save you from building the executable locally.

### JAR
* Check if you have Java 11 installed, if not [install it](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot)
* Download the [latest zip from the releases](https://github.com/ab-microstream-hackathon/fuel-filling-service/releases/latest)
* Unzip it and run it locally with ``java -jar fuel-filling-service.jar``
* Open http://localhost:8080 
â†’ you should get redirected to the OpenAPI UI


## Building / Executing it locally
