# fuel-filling-service [![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-online-success?logo=heroku)](https://hackathon-ms-fuel-filling.herokuapp.com) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/alb2k/fuel-filling-service/Check%20Build/develop)](https://github.com/alb2k/fuel-filling-service/actions/workflows/checkBuild.yml?query=branch%3Adevelop)
A helidon (microprofile) RESTful webservice with microstream.

The project represents a basic CRUD webservice where you can manage fuel fillings (of a car).<br>
It is also shipped with a nice UI (openapi-ui) so that no external REST/HTTP client is required.

There are prebuilt executables, which save you from building the executable locally.

### JAR
* Check if you have Java 11 installed, if not [install it](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot)
* Download the [latest zip from the releases](https://github.com/alb2k/fuel-filling-service/releases/latest) and unzip it
* Run ``java -jar fuel-filling-service.jar``
* Open http://localhost:8080 
→ you should get redirected to the OpenAPI UI
